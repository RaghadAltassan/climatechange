# Methodology

This study used Bayesian spatio-temporal modeling to examine the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and temperature patterns.

### Key Steps:
- **Data Collection**: Satellite-derived raster data from NASA Giovanni (CO₂, CH₄, and temperature).
- **Preprocessing**: Aggregated data by city boundaries using the `raster` and `sf` packages.
- **Modeling**: Implemented the **INLA** approach for efficient Bayesian inference, accounting for spatial and temporal effects.

### Why INLA?
The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) is ideal for large spatial datasets, offering:
- Speed and scalability
- Accurate posterior estimates
- Flexible modeling of spatial and temporal dependencies
