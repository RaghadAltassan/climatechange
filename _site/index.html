<div id="problem-of-the-study" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem of the Study</h3>
<p>Climate change has emerged as a global environmental concern, with
rising concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs)—notably carbon dioxide
(CO₂) and methane (CH₄)—accelerating global warming. Saudi Arabia, being
one of the world’s top oil producers, faces unique climate challenges
due to its arid conditions and industrial activities. This study
investigates how CO₂ and CH₄ emissions contribute to temperature changes
across the Kingdom using satellite-derived data and spatial
analysis.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="why-it-matters" class="section level3">
<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
<p>Understanding the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and
temperature trends is essential for tackling climate-related risks.
Saudi Arabia is especially vulnerable due to its extreme climate, rapid
urban growth, and heavy reliance on fossil fuels. This research provides
insights that support national environmental policies and sustainable
development goals—especially those set by the Saudi Green Initiative and
Vision 2030. It also empowers decision-makers with scientific evidence
to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change effectively.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="climate-trends-in-saudi-arabia" class="section level3">
<h3>Climate Trends in Saudi Arabia</h3>
<p>The Kingdom is characterized by harsh desert conditions, low
vegetation cover, and high industrial emissions. These factors make it a
critical region for understanding greenhouse gas dynamics and their
influence on rising surface temperatures. By analyzing temporal and
spatial variations from 2018 to 2021, this dashboard captures emission
patterns and temperature shifts at the city level.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="greenhouse-gas-distribution" class="section level3">
<h3>Greenhouse Gas Distribution</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>CO₂ Emissions</strong>: Primarily result from fossil fuel
combustion and industrial activity.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>CH₄ Emissions</strong>: Linked to agriculture, landfills,
and natural gas infrastructure.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Temperature Change</strong>: Increasing surface temperatures
indicate intensified heatwaves and environmental vulnerability.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="research-focus-and-objectives" class="section level3">
<h3>Research Focus and Objectives</h3>
<p>This study focuses on understanding the impact of greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions—specifically carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄)—on
climate variability in Saudi Arabia. Given the Kingdom’s arid climate,
urban expansion, and heavy reliance on fossil fuels, the research
investigates how rising GHG concentrations influence regional
temperature patterns.</p>
<p>The key objectives of this research are to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Analyze the <strong>annual spatial and temporal variability</strong>
of CO₂ and CH₄ concentrations across Saudi Arabian cities from 2018 to
2021.<br />
</li>
<li>Examine the <strong>relationship between greenhouse gas emissions
and climate change indicators</strong>, particularly land surface
temperature.<br />
</li>
<li>Utilize <strong>satellite-derived data and advanced spatial modeling
techniques</strong> (e.g., Bayesian Hierarchical Models with INLA) to
provide high-resolution assessments of GHG dynamics.<br />
</li>
<li>Offer <strong>scientific insights that support national and
international climate policies</strong>, such as Saudi Arabia’s Vision
2030 and the Saudi Green Initiative. This project focuses on Saudi
Arabia—a region with high emissions and environmental vulnerability. The
key research objectives are:<br />
</li>
<li>Analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of carbon dioxide (CO₂)
and methane (CH₄) emissions across Saudi Arabia from 2018 to 2021.<br />
</li>
<li>Examine how GHG concentrations relate to variations in surface
temperature.<br />
</li>
<li>Visualize emission patterns and temperature changes using
interactive maps.<br />
</li>
<li>Identify regional disparities in environmental risk.<br />
</li>
<li>Provide insights that support national policies for emissions
reduction and climate adaptation.</li>
</ol>

<div id="research-significance" class="section level3">
<h3>Research Significance</h3>
<p>By understanding where and how greenhouse gases accumulate—and how
they affect temperature—this research helps prioritize regions for
environmental action. The interactive dashboard delivers data-driven
insights that are crucial for evidence-based climate policy, regional
planning, and national sustainability strategies. The findings also
contribute to Saudi Arabia’s climate commitments under Vision 2030.</p>
